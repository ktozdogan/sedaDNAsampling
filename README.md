PROTOCOLS

Protocol for Tube Sampling from the Archaeological Section
Materials
Water-Bleach (5%) solution
Water
Bleach
Plastic bottle
Disposable gloves
Paper towels
Face masks
Disposable coveralls
Disposable spatulas (or metal spatulas)
Sterile spatula
50 mL tubes
Small zipped plastic bags
Equipment Setup & Procedure
Dress up:
Put on the gloves first, and clean the hands with bleach.
Put the mask on,
Put on the hair net, and the coverall (optional).
Put on another pair of gloves and clean your hands with bleach.
Take a spatula and clean it with bleach.
Use it to dig into the section about 3 cm.
Take another spatula and clean it with bleach.
⚠ - Can be used again for other samples after cleaning with bleach.


Take a 5/15 mL tube and position it under the dug section.		
⚠ The needed amount of soil sample is less than 100 mg per extraction (according to Rohland et al., 2018, Zavala et al.,2021).


Fill the tube partly with the soil from the section using a sterile spatula.
Close the lid and label the tube.
⚠ - Proper labeling is crucial. A label should include all the information about the sample’s location, sampling date, and (if known) archeological period.  The location information should be based on the system of the excavation.


Put the tube in a labeled zipped bag.
Dispose of the spatula and the pair of gloves.
⚠ - In case of a limited number of materials, clean them with bleach intensively to reuse them.


For the following sample, return to 1d and repeat the remaining steps.
